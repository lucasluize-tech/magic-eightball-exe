# Futher Study 2

1. For some reason some boxes are rendered round ( no idea what's causing this)
2. Did figure out a way to render all the boxes with different colors, but still need a better way
   to get an element from the components an change the state of that component.
   (break needed much?)

# Further study 3

it seems that both items, were already satisfied by this code. only implementation would be the
"changed" msg inside the box component.
